        <p class="fs-7 para">Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com
          in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire
          in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.Musk was born on
          June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that
          his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught
          himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.At age
          17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South
          African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier
          to obtain American citizenship via that path.In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the
          University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second
          bachelor’s degree in physics.After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a
          PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of
          Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995.
          Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.</p>

        <p class="fs-5 para text-decoration-underline"> Education</p>
        <p class="fs-7 para">Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a
          Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the
          University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South African
          military. Arriving in Canada in June 1989, Musk failed to locate his great-uncle in Montreal and instead
          stayed at a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan. He stayed there
          for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston,
          Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a
          Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in
          physics.</p>

        <p class="fs-5 para text-decoration-underline">Family</p>
        <p class="fs-7 para">His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada
          but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot,
          sailor, consultant, and property developer. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger
          sister, Tosca (born 1974).[His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian. His
          paternal grandmother had British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk
          lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, a choice he made two years after the divorce and
          subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he has described as "a terrible human
          being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done." He has a half-sister and a
          half-brother on his father's side</p>

        <p class="fs-5 para text-decoration-underline">Wealth</p>
        <p class="fs-7 para">In January 2021, Musk, with a net worth of $185 billion, surpasssed Amazon founder Jeff
          Bezos to become the richest person in the world Bezos reclaimed the top spot the following month.Around
          three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla. Musk has tied his personal earnings to Tesla's valuation
          and revenue.As he does not receive a salary, Musk agreed to a compensation plan with the board. It is an
          "at-risk performance award that ensures will be compensated only if Tesla and all of its shareholders do
          extraordinarily well." Created in 2018, the deal stipulated that Musk only receive the compensation if Tesla
          reached certain market values. It was the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board. In the first
          award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares - around one percent of the
          company - at below-market prices.</p>
