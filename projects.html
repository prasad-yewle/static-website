          <p class="para para2">At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of Earth's closest habitable
            neighbors. Mars is about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is
            a little cold, but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few
            other trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere.
            Gravity on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and bound around.
            Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.Starship will enter Mars’ atmosphere at 7.5
            kilometers per second and decelerate aerodynamically. The vehicle’s heat shield is designed to withstand
            multiple entries, but given that the vehicle is coming into Mars’ atmosphere so hot, we still expect to see
            some ablation of the heat shield (similar to wear and tear on a brake pad). The engineering video below
            simulates the physics of Mars entry for Starship.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="card-text para para2">The Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and freight transportation,
            first used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from Tesla and
            SpaceX.Hyperloop is described as a sealed tube or system of tubes with low air pressure through which a pod
            may travel substantially free of air resistance or friction. The Hyperloop could potentially convey people
            or objects at airline or hypersonic speeds while being energy efficient compared with existing high-speed
            rail systems.This, if implemented, may reduce travel times compared to train and airplane travel over
            distances of under approximately 1,500 kilometres (930 miles). Elon Musk first publicly mentioned the
            Hyperloop in 2012. His initial concept incorporated reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules
            ride on air bearings driven by linear induction motors and axial compressors. The Hyperloop Alpha concept
            was first published in August 2013, proposing and examining a route.</p>

          <p class="card-text para para2">Starlink is a satellite internet constellation being constructed by SpaceX
            providing satellite Internet access. The constellation will consist of thousands of mass-produced small
            satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), working in combination with ground transceivers. SpaceX plans to sell
            some of the satellites for military, scientific, or exploratory purposes. The SpaceX satellite development
            facility in Redmond, Washington houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing, and orbit control.
            The cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX
            in May 2018 to be at least US$10 billion. Product development began in 2015. Two prototype test-flight
            satellites were launched in February 2018. Additional test satellites and 60 operational satellites were
            deployed in May 2019. As of September 2020, SpaceX was launching up to 60 satellites at a time, aiming to
            deploy 1,440[10] of the 260 kg (570 lb) spacecraft to provide near-global service.</p>

      <p class="collapse para para2" id="moreinfo">The communication satellite network SpaceX envisions was publicly
        announced in January 2015, with bandwidth to carry up to 50% of all backhaul communications traffic, and up to
        10% of local Internet traffic, in high-density cities.CEO Elon Musk said that there is significant unmet demand
        for low-cost global broadband capabilities.

        The opening of the SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond was announced by SpaceX in January 2015 with
        partners, to develop and build out the new communication network. At the time, the Seattle-area office planned
        to initially hire approximately 60 engineers, and potentially 1000 people by 2018. The company operated in 2,800
        m2 (30,000 sq ft) of leased space by late 2016, and by January 2017 had taken on a 2,800 m2 (30,000 sq ft)
        second facility, both in Redmond. In August 2018, SpaceX consolidated all their Seattle-area operations with a
        move to a larger three-building facility at Redmond Ridge Corporate Center to support satellite manufacturing in
        addition to R&D.

        In July 2016, SpaceX acquired a 740 m2 (8,000 sq ft) creative space in Irvine, California (Orange County).
        SpaceX job listings indicated the Irvine office would include signal processing, RFIC, and ASIC development for
        the satellite program.

        By January 2016, the company had publicly disclosed plans to have two prototype satellites flying in 2016, and
        to have the initial satellite constellation in orbit and operational by approximately 2020.

        By October 2016, SpaceX had developed the initial satellites that they hoped to launch and test in 2017, but the
        satellite division was focusing on a significant business challenge of achieving a sufficiently low-cost design
        for the user equipment, aiming for something that ostensibly can be installed easily at end-user premises for
        approximately US$200. Overall, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said then that the project remained in the
        "design phase as the company seeks to tackle issues related to user-terminal cost". Deployment of the
        constellation was not then projected until "late in this decade or early in the next".
